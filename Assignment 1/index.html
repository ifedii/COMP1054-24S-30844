            [Intro]
            So much trouble in the world
            So much trouble in the world

            [Verse 1]
            Bless my eyes this morning
            Jah sun is on the rise once again
            The way earthly thing's are going
            Anything can happen

            You see men sailing on their ego trip
            Blast off on their spaceship
            Million miles from reality
            No care for you, no care for me

            [Verse 2]
            So much trouble in the world;
            So much trouble in the world
            All you got to do: give a little (give a little)
            Give a little (give a little), give a little (give a little)!
            One more time, ye-ah! (give a little) Ye-ah! (give a little)
            Ye-ah! (give a little) Yeah!

            [Verse 3]
            So you think you've found the solution
            But it's just another illusion!
            (So before you check out this tide)
            Don't leave another cornerstone
            Standing there behind, eh-eh-eh-eh!
            We've got to face the day
            (Ooh) Ooh-wee, come what may
            We the street people talking
            Yeah, we the people struggling
            See upcoming R&B shows
            Get tickets for your favorite artists

            [Verse 4]
            Now they sitting on a time bomb; (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
            Now I know the time has come: (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
            What goes on up is coming on down, (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
            Goes around and comes around. (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)

            [Outro]
            So much trouble in the world
            So much trouble in the world
            So much trouble in the world
            There is so much trouble (so much trouble in the world)
            There is so much trouble
            There is so much trouble (so much in the world)
            There is so much trouble
            There is so much trouble in the world (so much trouble in the world)
            There is (so much in the world)
            (So much trouble in the world)
